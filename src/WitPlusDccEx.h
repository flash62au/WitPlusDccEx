Version information:

0.0.1 - Initial version


Version changes in the preceding WiThrottleProtocol library

1.1.27   - Minor updates to the examples. 
         - Additional example of using mDNS to browse for WiThrottle servers
         - Additional example of using multiThrottle methods
1.1.26   - Update the heartbeat timer when unknown commands are received
1.1.25   - Simplify the heartbeat send, as this was creating problems for JMRI
1.1.24   - Add support for forcing a function
1.1.23   - Fix for individual loco direction (facing) changes in a consist
1.1.22   - Fix for the original 'steal' code
1.1.21   - Add support for setting the Speed Step mode 28/128/14 etc.  setSpeedSteps(), getSpeedSteps()
1.1.20   - Corrected the EStop for 'all' throttles
1.1.18/19- Added support for logLevel. Assigned levels to every log message
         - changed all the log messages so that it is clearer which came from this library
1.1.17   - fix version numbers. no code change
1.1.15/16   - fix a bug where the speeds were not being updated when changed on another device
1.1.14   - addition of 'sendCommand(String cmd);
1.1.13   - Bug fix for ESTOP
1.1.12   - Add support for broadcast messages and alerts
1.1.11   - Change to the fix for the _wifiTrax WFD-30, so that leading CR+LF is always sent
         - Removal of setSpeedCommandShouldBeSenttwice(bool twice)
1.1.10   - discarded
1.1.9    - discarded         
1.1.8    - Addition of setSpeedCommandShouldBeSenttwice(bool twice)
1.1.7    - Addition of minimum time separation/delay between commands sent
1.1.6    - Change to support 32 functions
1.1.5    - Adjust the aggressive heartbeat
1.1.4    - Use more aggressive heartbeat commands
1.1.3    - Add add ability to specify which loco in a consist is sent a function co…
1.1.2    - Bug fix
1.1.1    - Improve consist support
1.1.0    - Muiti-throttle support added
